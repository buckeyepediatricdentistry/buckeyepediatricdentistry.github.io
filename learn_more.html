    <h4>Dental Cleaning</h4>
    <h2>Your child’s teeth will be cleaned by one of our highly trained dental hygienists to remove plaque and tarter deposits that can cause gum disease and cavities. Routine dental cleanings (every 6 months for most patients) have been shown to be an extremely effective way to prevent dental disease and build your child's confidence in the dental setting. <br />
    <a href="http://www.aapd.org/publications/brochures/regdent.asp" target="_blank"><img src="images/arrow.png" width="5" height="9" border="0" /> Learn More</a></h2>
<h4>X-rays</h4>
    <h2> X-rays are a necessary part of your child's dental health. They allow us to see cavities we cannot see with our eyes only, monitor teeth after a dental injury, assess dental development and plan for orthodontic care. When cavities are diagnosed early, they are smaller and the treatment is easier and more comfortable for your child.  Without x-rays, cavities will be missed.  Our office utilizes digital X-rays which allows us to decrease the amount of radiation exposure.  Studies have shown that the amount of radiation emitted by dental X-rays is very small.  We will further protect your child by covering them with a lead apron.  The risk of pain and / or infection to your child from not receiving the recommended X-rays is much greater than any risk from radiation.  <a href="http://www.aapd.org/publications/brochures/xray.asp" target="_blank"><br />

<h4>Fluoride</h4>
    <h2>Topical fluoride will be applied to your child's teeth to make them stronger and more resistant to cavities. Using fluoride for the prevention and control of decay is proven to be both safe and effective. <br />

    <h4>Sealants</h4>
    <h2>The chewing surfaces of children’s teeth are the most susceptible to cavities. Sealants are a tooth colored “paint” applied to the grooves of the back permanent teeth and are highly effective in preventing tooth decay.    http://www.aapd.org/publications/brochures/sealants.asp<br />

    <h4>Fillings</h4>
    <h2>When your child has a small cavity or has fractured a tooth, a tooth colored filling material will be used to fill the area missing from the trauma or where the cavity was removed.<br />
    </h2>
    <h4>Crowns/ Caps</h4>
    <h2>Stainless steel crowns are used to restore teeth where the cavity is too big to hold a filling.</h2>
    <h4>Nerve Treatment</h4>
    <h2>Pulp therapy (pulpotomy / pulpectomy) is the treatment of infected nerves in the teeth. Nerve treatment is usually necessary as a result of extensive tooth decay or dental injury.  Failure to provide the necessary pulp therapy could result in your child experiencing pain, infection, swelling, or loss of the tooth. </h2>
    <h4>Extractions</h4>
    <h2>Extractions are done as a last resort, unless needed for orthodontic reasons.  Extractions are  usually necessary because a cavity has entered the nerve of the tooth and caused infection or destroyed too much tooth structure to repair the tooth. If a baby molar is removed prematurely, a space maintainer will be placed. </h2>
    <h4>Space Maintenance</h4>
    <h2>Space maintainers are used to hold space for the permanent tooth when a baby tooth has been lost too early. If space is not maintained, teeth on either side of the space can drift, preventing the permanent tooth from erupting.<br />
    </h2>
    <h4>Mouthguards</h4>
    <h2>When your child begins to participate in organized sports, injuries can occur. A properly fitted mouth guard is an important piece of athletic gear that can help protect your child’s smile. Mouth guards help prevent broken teeth, and injuries to the lips, tongue, face or jaw.   <br />

    <h4>Bleaching</h4>
    <h2>Teenagers are influenced by the dazzling white smiles seen on TV and in movies.  So, it’s not surprising that they want to have perfectly white smiles too. However, one must remember that children’s permanent teeth are never as white as their baby teeth. According to the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD), teens who want a whiter smile should seek a dentist's supervision. Teens should wait to use whitening products until at least the age of 14. By this time, the tooth's nerve is fully formed, which means a teen will experience less sensitivity.</h2>
    <h4>Laughing Gas / Nitrous Oxide</h4>
    <h2>Nitrous oxide is a safe and effective gas that your child will breathe through a good smelling, non-intimidating rubber nose.  It is used to calm a child’s fear of the dental visit and enhance effective communication. it is also effective at suppressing gagging for children whose gag reflex interferes with dental treatment.  <br />

    <h4>General Anesthesia</h4>
    <h2>General anesthesia may be indicated for children with extensive dental needs, children who are extremely uncooperative, fearful or anxious, or for the very young who do not understand how to cope in a cooperative manner. General anesthesia also can be helpful for patients with special health care needs. Our dentists at Buckeye Pediatric Dentistry treat patients at Nationwide Children's Hospital in the Dental Surgery Center with specialized dental and pediatric anesthesiologists.  <br />

    <h4>Emergencies</h4>
    <h2>If your child has experienced a dental emergency after hours then please call the office at 614-575-2225 and you will be given instructions on how to reach the pediatric dentist on call.  For any injury involving the head or that may require stitches please proceed to the nearest hospital.  For any life threatening injuries please call 911 immediately.  http://www.aapd.org/publications/brochures/ecare.asp<br />
